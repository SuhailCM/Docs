VM works with protocol smart contracts, as a user you do not have access to VM. You just request actions on smart contracts and then VM will pick them if they are valid.

This modularity makes the THIRM PROTOCOL safe from hacks and as for spam attacks; since requesting action on smart contract costs gas and as it will costs spammers a lot of money, it prevents them from using any sort of spam attack in turn preventing spam attacks on THIRM PROTOCOL.
