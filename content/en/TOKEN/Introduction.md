THIRM Token is a governance/ownership tracking smart contract written on the Ethereum blockchain. Profits generated by the THIRM PROTOCOL are distributed to the THIRM TOKEN holders in the form of Token Buyback.

Companies typically buy back token when they have extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise. Share repurchases are great news for investors because they lift stock prices by limiting the supply of shares available for sale. “Buyback-and-burn” may be a terminology specific to digital assets, but the idea is the same as with traditional share repurchase programs: The issuer buys back previously issued tokens on the secondary market, to reduce supply and thus increase market prices


## Rights

THIRM Token Holders create proposals and vote on every decision the PROTOCOL implements. By voting, we ensure that we go in the direction agreed on by the majority of holders.
