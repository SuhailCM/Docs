Tokenomics is the study of how cryptocurrencies work within the broader ecosystem. This includes such things as token distribution as well as how they can be used to incentivize positive behavior.

THIRM VM is built with a vision for the future and the THIRM token is the fuel for the THIRM PROTOCOL. For every operation requested the user needs to burn THIRM, thus deflating the total supply.

Unlike most other projects which charge a percentage per operation as developer fees, THIRM PROTOCOL pays no commission to the developers or the company.

So, how do we pay for our expenses? To cover our expenses, new tokens are minted by the TRUSTEES. This can only be approved through governance voting by THIRM token holders. Minting access is not granted to anyoneâ€™s personal wallet, it is only granted to the governance safe smart contract. Thus all earnings generated by the PROTOCOL go to THIRM holders, deducting PROTOCOL Expenses (e.g., servers, VM fees, etc.).

All the above-given factors make THIRM token total supply a dynamic ever-changing variable that should always be checked on our Ethereum contract.
